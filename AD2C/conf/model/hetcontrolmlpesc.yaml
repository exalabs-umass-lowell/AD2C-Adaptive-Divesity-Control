# Model name (do not change)
name: hetcontrolmlpesc

# List of layers in the MLP.
num_cells: [256, 256]
# Activation class between MLP layers.
activation_class: torch.nn.Tanh

# --- Extremum Seeking Control (ESC) Parameters ---

tau: 0.01

# The learning rate/gain (K) for the ESC integrator. Controls how quickly the
# controller adapts the scaling factor.
# esc_gain: 0.05
esc_gain: 0


# The amplitude (a) of the dither signal. This is the size of the "jiggle"
# applied to the scaling factor to probe the performance gradient.
# esc_amplitude: 0.25
esc_amplitude: 0


# The frequency (Ï‰) of the dither signal. Controls how fast the "jiggle" oscillates.
# esc_frequency: 0.5
esc_frequency: 0


# The initial value for the diversity scaling factor (k_hat). A good starting
# point for the controller's search.
initial_k: 1.0

# --- Standard Parameters ---

# Whether to process the homogeneous part of the policy
# with a tanh squashing operation to the action space domain
process_shared: True

# Parameter filled dynamically. Do not change.
probabilistic: null
# Parameter filled dynamically. Do not change.
scale_mapping: null

# desired_snd: 0.5
